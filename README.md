# miTS_Pathway
A step to step guide on mining cancer biomarker based on **mi**croRNA data and **T**issue **S**pecificity of disease (**miTS**) + Molecular Pathway Investigation.

The miTS Pathway method has been discussed previously on IOP Journal of Physics: Conference Series (Indexes by SCOPUS) in article [**Mining Potential MicroRNA Biomarkers related to IQGAPs of Tyroid Carcinoma through *in silico* process**](http://commdis.telkomuniversity.ac.id/icodis/2018/). In this repository, the demonstration of the method  was provided.
